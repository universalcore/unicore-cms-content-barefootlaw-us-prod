  "content": "When parents or other individuals legally or practically responsible for a child are unable to provide proper protection or care, local or state authorities may step in to assume care of the child. A child's welfare and development should always be the guiding principle for any such decisions about who should take care of a child in place of his or her parents or guardians.\r\n\r\nA child who cannot live with his or her family has the right to protection and aid from local and state authorities. The child may be placed with another family or in an institution for children, where a child\u2019s culture, language and religion should be respected. \r\n\r\nWhen a child can no longer live with his or her parents and acquires new parents, this is referred to as \u201cadoption.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdoption must take place in the framework of all applicable federal and state law, and may occur only if adoption improves the child\u2019s life. Adoption is permitted only if the parents, legal representatives and all other persons concerned have given their informed consent. These people do not have the right to extract profit from a child's adoption (for example, by receiving money). \r\n\r\nWhen a child is not living with his or her family (but, as the case may be, in a hospital, foster family or institution for children), his or her situation should be assessed regularly and rigorously to ascertain whether the living conditions remain optimal for the child. \r\n\r\nNext article: ",
