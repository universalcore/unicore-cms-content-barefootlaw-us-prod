(Article 4)\r\n\r\nStates must make the laws on children\u2019s rights known and obeyed by both adults and children in their countries. (Article 42)\r\n \r\nGovernments and international organisations (such as UNICEF) must work to ensure that children\u2019s rights are protected.  The Convention explains how governments and international organisations can work together to ensure that all children can exercise each of their rights.
