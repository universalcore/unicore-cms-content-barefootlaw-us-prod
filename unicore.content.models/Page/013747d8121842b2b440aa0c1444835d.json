Regardless of who they are or where they are learning, ***all*** children have the right to a quality education that supports their intellectual, imaginative, moral, and psychosocial growth. School is vital as a preparation for adult life, and should, among other things, teach children how to get along with others, be and caring and respectful towards other people and towards the environment, be resilient, resourceful, and imaginative, and be well-prepared to pursue happiness in their adult lives.\r\n\r\nChildren have the right to know what is important for their welfare. Radio, television, books, newspapers, computers, etc. help them to grow up and educate themselves. Adults should make sure that the information they receive is positive and help them to find and understand whatever information they need to grow, learn, explore, imagine, and care about others and the environment.\r\n\r\nNext article: ",
