  "content": "Children have the right to express their opinions on all subjects concerning them. Their views should be respected and taken into account, according to their age and maturity. Before an important decision concerning a child is taken, the child should be asked to express his or her view of the matter.\r\n\r\nChildren have the right to free expression. This means that they have the freedom to seek, receive and share information and ideas with others. Through speech, art or drawing, children may express all their thoughts, provided that they respect the law and other people.\r\n \r\nChildren have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion: they can choose their religion or decide not to believe in any God, and may have their own opinion on the world and the people in it. Their parents should support their decision-making without forcing them. \r\n\r\nA child\u2019s freedom to show his or her religion or convictions can be limited only by the law\u2014when, for example, such freedom is a threat to public safety and order.\r\n \r\nChildren have the right to meet among themselves or with adults, and to create or be part of an association or group, as long as they respect the law and harm no one.\r\n\r\nNext article: ",
