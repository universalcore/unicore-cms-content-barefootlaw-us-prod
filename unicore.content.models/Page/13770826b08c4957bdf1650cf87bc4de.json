Children must be protected against all forms of violence (physical, mental and sexual), against abandonment or negligence, and against mistreatment and exploitation.\r\n\r\nChildren are to be protected from drugs. They may not buy, sell or produce drugs.\r\n\r\nChildren should be protected against all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual violence.\r\n\r\nAdults may not force children to do something dangerous.\r\n \r\nNo one has the right to steal, kidnap or sell a child.\r\n\r\nUnless mandated by a court or local authorities in order to protect a child from harm, a child may not be taken far from his or her parents without his or her agreement, and may not be forcibly kept away from them, since this constitutes kidnapping.\r\n\r\nIf a child has been kidnapped, state and local authorities will act to free the child and return him or her to the appropriate family, wherever that child is.\r\n\r\nNext article: ",
