They have the right to know their parents when this is possible, and to be brought up by them, unless they have been legally and appropriately adopted by other parents or when a court has granted legal guardianship to other individuals with the best interests of a child as their guiding principle of care.\r\n\r\nEvery child\u2019s identity shall be recognized, protected and documented. A child\u2019s name, nationality, language, culture, and family relationships constitute part of a child\u2019s identity.\r\n\r\nIf a child is deprived of his or her identity, state and local authorities should work to protect it and help re-establish it.\r\n\r\nNext article:",
