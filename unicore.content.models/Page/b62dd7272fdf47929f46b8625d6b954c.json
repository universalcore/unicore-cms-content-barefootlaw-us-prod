If that is impossible because one or more parents is/are absent, or because they mistreat the child, a child still has the right to know where his or her parents are.\r\n\r\nIf his or her parents live in different localities, states or countries, a child still has the right to see or have contact with both of them, unless a court has prohibited or restricted parental visitation or contact in order to protect a child from harm.\r\n\r\nIn many areas and activities, and dependent on applicable federal or state law, children have the right to privacy. \r\n\r\nBoth parents are responsible for the education and development of their children.  Parents should always be guided by the idea of doing what is best for their children.   If parents are unable to care for a child, appropriate state or local authorities or courts may assume legal guardianship of a child, may appoint someone else, such as a relative, as a legal guardian of the child, and/or may choose to appoint others as foster parents of the child under the supervision of city or state agencies and courts charged with overseeing the welfare of children.\r\n\r\nNext article: ",
