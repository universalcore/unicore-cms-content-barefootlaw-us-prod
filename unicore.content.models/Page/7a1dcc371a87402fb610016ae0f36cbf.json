  "content": "Unless permitted by federal, state or local laws under very exceptional circumstances, children who have made mistakes should never be put in prison with adults, sentenced to death or to life imprisonment. Imprisonment of children should be avoided whenever possible, and children should never be mistreated while in prison under any circumstances.  If a child must be imprisoned, parents should be able to continue to see their child, and the child should receive schooling, healthcare and other resources necessary for normal growth and development while in prison.  Judges, police and guardians must obey all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to children and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nA child accused of a crime must be treated properly according to federal, state and local laws and regulations.  These regulations may, in many circumstances, require a child's parent(s) to be present *before* a child may be questioned by the police.  Every child has the right to a lawyer. Every child has the right to a fair trial or evidentiary hearing and, if found guilty of a crime, to sentencing that respects the child\u2019s rights in age-appropriate ways.  All children who are imprisoned should be well-prepared to re-enter society upon release.\r\n\r\nNext article: ",
